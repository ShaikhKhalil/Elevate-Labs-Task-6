# Elevate-Labs-Task-6
This task demonstrates subqueries and nested queries in the khalil_library database, including scalar, correlated, IN, NOT IN, EXISTS, and derived table queries. It enables advanced filtering, aggregation, and retrieval without direct joins, enhancing complex SQL query skills.

## Queries Included
1. **Scalar Subquery** – Books published after the average published year.
2. **IN** – Members who borrowed books.
3. **NOT IN** – Members who never borrowed books.
4. **Correlated Subquery** – Members who borrowed more than one book.
5. **Subquery in FROM** – Category with the most books.
6. **EXISTS** – Authors who have books in the library.
7. **Aggregate Comparison** – Book with the earliest published year.

2. Ensure the `khalil_library` database and sample data from previous tasks are loaded.
3. Open `khalil_library_task6.sql`.
4. Execute queries one by one to see each subquery result.
